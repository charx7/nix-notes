## About these pages

```
$ nix-build -A site
@result@
```

These pages are served by NixOS, running on a Digital Ocean virtual machine.
They describe how you can build the same virtual machine image and how to run
it.

All you need is a copy of the following repository:
[github.com/noteed/nix-notes](https://github.com/noteed/nix-notes).

By running the above command, you'll build these pages. By running the command
of the [next page](image.md), you'll build the complete virtual machine image.
